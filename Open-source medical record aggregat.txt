Open-source medical record aggregation project

Fasten is an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 100,000's of insurance/hospitals/clinics. Fasten is a self-hosted electronic medical records system designed for families. It supports the FHIR protocol commonly used in the medical industry and employs OAuth2 authentication, eliminating the need for passwords. With multi-user support, it enables households to manage their health information collectively. In the future, it plans to incorporate dashboards for tracking diagnostic tests and integrate with smart devices and wearables. There are two versions of Fasten: one for testing with synthetic data and limited healthcare provider connections, and another for accessing personal medical records from over 650 healthcare providers. Fasten can be easily set up through Docker and accessed via a web browser. Users can create an account and explore the system's features securely.
